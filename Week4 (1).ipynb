    "### This page on wikipedia \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_neighborhoods_of_St._Louis\" provides the list of neighborhoods in St. Louis, MO. Web scraping techniques will be employed to extract data from this page, using Python requests and Beautifulsoup package. Later, Python Geocoder will be used to obtain the geographical coordinates of the neighborhoods. Then, the Foursquare API is used to get the venue data. It will provide various categories of venue data inclusding shopping malls. This will help us tackle our business problem. After that, data preparation and wrangling will be applied to finally buid a clustering machine learning model (K-means for this proeject). Finally, Folium will be used for map visualization. "
